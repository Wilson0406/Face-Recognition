# Face-Recognition

A real time face recognition system in Python using Pillow, OpenCV and NumPy.

# Steps
1. Create two folders named, dataset and trainer in the main folder.
2. Run face_capture.ipynb/face_capture.py file as many times as the number of person's face you want to capture and enter id(as per convenience but single digit for simplifications and different id for different faces).
3. Run face_trainer.ipynb/face_trainer.py file to train the model.
4. Run face_recognition.ipynb/face_recognition.py file to check the face recognition.
